## ðŸš€ [Alins](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins): The most pure and elegant WebUI framework

**[ä¸­æ–‡](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins/blob/master/README.cn.md) | [Documentation](https://alinsjs.github.io/docs) | [Playground](https://alinsjs.github.io/playground/) | [Update Log](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins/blob/master/scripts/helper/version.md) | [Feedback Errors/Defects](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins/issues/new) | [Gitee](https://gitee.com/alinsjs/alins) | [Message Board](https://theajack.github.io/message-board/?app=alins)**

## 0 Introduction

### 0.1 Preface

Alins is an extremely pure, simple, and elegant web UI framework. It adheres to the development philosophy of 0-API and Less is More, aiming to help developers escape the dilemma of complex API calls in UI frameworks and provide the most intuitive, pure, and close-to-vanillajs development approach.

You only need to understand the syntax rules of JSX (similar to HTML) to develop Alins web applications without any obstacles. Below is a basic counter example that you can [experience online in the playground](https://alinsjs.github.io/playground/#4):

```jsx
let count = 1;
<button onclick={count++} $mount='#App'>
     count is {count}
</button>;
```

### 0.2 Features

1. [x] 0-API, Less is More, closest to native JavaScript development.
2. [x] Powerful reactivity, supports reactive updates for properties, styles, text, HTML, and other elements.
3. [x] High performance (superior to Vue3 and React).
4. [x] Does not use virtual DOM (vdom), directly updates UI at a granular level.
5. [x] Extremely small runtime and bundle size (better than Vue3 and React).
6. [x] Supports two-way data binding, component development, and follows a unidirectional data flow.
7. [x] Built-in data sharing solution, easily manages shared data among components.
8. [x] Rich ecosystem support, compatible with plugins such as Vite, Rollup, Webpack, and esbuild. It can also customize third-party tools based on the underlying compilation module.
9. [x] Supports if and switch logic, as well as If, Switch, For, and other logical components.
10. [x] Supports custom renderers for cross-platform development.
11. [x] Uses JSX and TSX to describe UI, with built-in TypeScript compilation support.
12. [x] Developed using TypeScript, with highly friendly type support.

### 0.3 TODO

The following peripheral tools are currently under development, and we also hope that interested developers can participate together:

1. [ ] [alins-router](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins-router): Single-page application routing solution
2. [ ] [alins-ssr](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins-ssr): Server-side rendering solution
3. [ ] [alins-ui](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins-ui): Official UI library (consider implementing ant-design or meterial-design)
3. [ ] [alins-v](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins-v): Official form validation library
4. [ ] [alins-term](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins-term): Tool for developing command line applications based on custom renderers
5. [ ] [alins-canvas](https://github.com/alinsjs/alins-canvas): Tool for developing applications with canvas based on custom renderers

## 1 Quick Start

### 1.1 Command line creation

```
npm create alins
```

After following the steps, execute the following command to install and run it.

```
cd <project>
npm i
npm rundev
```

You can also directly clone the [template code repository](https://github.com/alinsjs/ebuild-template-alins)

### 1.2 Using the Web Compiler

```html
<script src='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/alins-compiler-web'></script>
<script type='text/alins'>
     let count = 1;
     <button onclick={count++} $$body>
         count is {count}
     </button>;
</script>
```

Note:
1. This approach is not recommended for production environments.
2. You can use type='text/babel' to enable syntax highlighting provided by the editor.

You can also freely use it in the [playground](https://alinsjs.github.io/playground/#48), which also utilizes a web compiler.
